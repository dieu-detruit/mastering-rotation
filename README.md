# mastering rotation

Rotation is the one thing we all end up doing every day.

You try to compute a quaternion or rotation matrix and suddenly you’re stuck on classics like:

“Which direction is this transform again?”

“Euler angles → quaternion… what was the convention?”

“If I swap these axes, what rotation does that correspond to?”

Next thing you know, you’ve asked ChatGPT, received an answer with maximum confidence and minimum correctness, and lost another chunk of your day.

It’s time for mastering-rotation, which provides a few small, frequently-used rotation calculators with a clean, simple UI.

I don't know you can master rotation math with it though.
